				<td><img class="img-fluid" src="reyna.png" height="700px" width="750px"></td>
				<td><p>Reyna is my favorite agent in my favorite online game, Valorant. She originates from the country of Mexico, and is the 11th agent released in this game. Two of her abilities are connected to her skills (heal and dismiss), which means that she needs to get either a kill or an assist before she could use these. She is a duelist agent, meaning her teammates expect her to be a fragger. She also has the ability to blind her enemies. And take note that she is always thirsty to get what she wants.</p></td>

				<td scope="row" style="font-family: aclonica; background-color: lightpink;">Ariel</td>
				<td><img class="img-fluid" src="ariel.png" height="200px" width="250px"></td>
				<td><p>Ariel, from the movie “The Little Mermaid”, is a young mermaid who wishes to become human for the love of her life. Her resilience and determination are what make her unique. Fun fact, she actually  has the ability to talk to animals (specifically sea creatures)! This simply concludes that she is my favorite Disney Princess.</p></td>

				<td scope="row" style="font-family: aclonica; background-color: deepskyblue;">Optimus Prime</td>
				<td><img class="img-fluid" src="optimus prime.png" height="200px" width="250px"></td>
				<td><p>Optimus Prime is one of the main characters in the movie “Transformers”. He symbolizes technological advancements nowadays. A mix of robotic and real-life features are what make him special. He can transform from a truck to a robot in human-form. He is also known to be the strongest, largest, and smartest out of all Autobots. Usually, he is the leader of his group.</p></td>

				<td scope="row" style="font-family: aclonica; background-color: yellow;">Monkey D. Luffy</td>
				<td><img class="img-fluid" src="luffy.png" height="100px" width="200px"></td>
				<td><p>Monkey D. Luffy, also known as Luffy, comes from my favorite anime series “One Piece”. This teenage boy is very cheerful and determined to achieve a certain goal, which is to become the greatest pirate of all time. Even with all the challenges he has faced, he is very optimistic. His straw hat is one thing one associates with him the most.</p></td>

			<tr>
				<td scope="row" style="font-family: aclonica; background-color: turquoise;">Envy</td>
				<td><img class="img-fluid" src="envy.png" height="200px" width="250px"></td>
				<td><p>Envy, from the recently released movie “Inside Out 2”, is my current favorite character in this movie. She’s just so cute! She’s even the color teal, which is one of my favorite colors. Just by hearing her name, her emotion is basically jealousy. She is also known to always agree with Anxiety, since she looks up to her.</p></td>
